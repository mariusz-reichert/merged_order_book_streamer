This program streams as a grpc service:
- top 10 bids
- top 10 asks
- a spread 
of a merged order book for given symbol.

It currently supports Bitstamp and Binance Com exchanges.

Too build it: `cargo build`
To configure symbols: `./target/debug/configure_symbols -c ./resources/exchanges.toml -s ./resources/symbols.txt`
To start streaming data: `./target/debug/stream_market_data -c ./resources/exchanges.toml -s ./resources/symbols.txt`

Open todos:
- implement grpc server using tonic library
- get rid of String and cloning and use string slice if possible
